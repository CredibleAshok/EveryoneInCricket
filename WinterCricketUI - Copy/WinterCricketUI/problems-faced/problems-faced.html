    /*This query gives information
    1. which team won
    2. how many runs winning team made
    3. how many wickets they lost
    --------
    To gather information about how many overs they played, a separate logic before running this query is
    required and hence this would become a stored procedure then
    alternate to this problem will be
    1. add one column in match table as LostBy, this column will be used for joining individual scores for over bowled. count number of overs bowled for opposite team and show them with
    other. for example, lets say team 1 bowled 15 overs and team 2 bowled 23 overs. Then 23 become number of played overs for team 1 and 15 for team2.

    2. capture this information sepaetely not in individual scores, keep this into another table because this information is not related to any player.

    <p>The cast to value type 'System.Int32' failed because the materialized value is null. Either the result type's generic parameter or the query must use a nullable type.</p>
    <p>
        My table structure is like this.
        Result
        Match
        Individiual Score --- this has null value in bowling type and is a foreign key from bowling type
        Bowling Type
        My problem goes away when i make the receiver also as null, means made null to int property in dto because it was null in model class


    <p>Your title remains even if you delete the title tag, but as you change it, it is there.</p>
    <p>value vs constant, .value and .constant both are same except It is worth pointing out that constants can be injected everywhere and values are limited to controllers, directives and services.</p>
    <p>how to use filterfilter on nested values. like i did in filterFilter(vm.allMatches, { 'matchStateId': 1, matchTypeDetails:{matchTypeId : parseInt(matchTypeId)}}, true)</p>
    <p>nested ui-views</p>
    <p>
        matching urls like
        for example 'api\/getResults' will also match
        and e2e will send data for 'api\/getResults' url instead of 'api\/getResultsByMember'

        boostrap support 12 column grid system. but does not support odd numbers, or take it other way round that it might support but i don't know.
        so the problem was to equually divide a row into 7 equal columns
        we can divide it not 12 columns of width 1 each, 6 columns of width 2 each, 4 columns of width 3 each, 3 columns of width 4 each, 2 columns of width 6 each,
        but, what if we need 5 equal columns, 7 equal columns, 9 or eleven equal columns. Then we need to override the width  property of columns as
        .oddColSupport  .col-md-2 {
        width: 14.285714285714285714285714285714%;
        }
        alternate is, we can have a customized bootstrap, for example instead of 12 column grid system, we can have it as 14 column grid system. divide the row
        in equal 7 columns, but you need to have a different name for this class, otherwise normal class may not have precedence. col-md-2 is same in both
        css files, so name the other something different.

    <p>how to load a page by default. I used tabs, under tabs, used anchor tags, ng-class for showing them active and $state.go('state-name') for opening certain page.</p>
    <p>
        state names are case sensitive, for example 'about' and 'About' are two different states. If you use one in {
        name: 'hello',
        stateConfig: {
        url: '/hello',
        templateUrl: 'app/UI/hello-world/hello.html'
        }
        }
        and wanted to use in ui-sref like
    <p>db time means local time. local time of time zone where database exists.</p>
    <p>3 kinds, utc, local and unspecified(this is utc by default.)</p>
    <p>UI always passing utc even if we do not convert into universal time.</p>
    <a ui-sref="About">About</a>, this will give you error.
    <p>gitignore file is used to ignore temporary files in commits.</p>
    <p>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: This is a skype holding port 80</p>
    <p>iis not finding home.html page. because, ng-include='/app/UI/home.html' but instead it should be like this 'app/UI/home.html' and this was working on my local computer.</p>
    <p>for active directory kerbors are used. This sends identity in header to service and service just picks identity.name. from here service gets whole user data.</p>
    <p>
        services are singleton. for example if created a service security, in this security service i have one method for getting the user details and other method for storing these details.
        now if i use this service on any controller and wanted to access the data returned by the service in first instance. i can use, i will still have the data there. That is why services are singleton
    </p>
    <p>
        if any change to model happens outside angularjs context, then to update model we need to trigger digest cycle manually. for example if we update scope.message in setTimeout function, it will not update
        because setTimeout is javascript function. so to automatically update view we need to user angualar's $interval. So be careful on this.

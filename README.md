I started this project as a learning for AngularJs. I kept on putting almost all angularJs concepts into this. Anyone who wants to learn building angularApps this might be a good starting point. Bare minimum dependencies are used in this repository.
Major Focuses are on following topics.
1. Routes using ui-router
2. Smart table using filters and a global search accross whole data.
3. Use of test / fake data. So no dependency of database or web api to fetch data.
